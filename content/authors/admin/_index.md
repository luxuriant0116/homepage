Welcome to my homepage!

I am a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Xiaomeng LI](https://xmengli.github.io/) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My main research interest lies in leveraging AI to tackle problems in healthcare, e.g. disease diagnosis and medical report generation. I currently focus on adopting multi-modal intelligence to enhance medical tasks. Previously, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree at [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/) majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My research experiences include being an intern at [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Dr. Libo Qin](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=8lVpK1QAAAAJ&hl) and [Prof. Wanxiang Che](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~car/).
